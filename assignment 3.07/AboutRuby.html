<h1>About Me</h1>
<body>
    <p>
        My name is Ruby Lewis, my pronouns are she/her. I work on behalf of the company NatureMatters LLC. <br>
        I've been interested in nature from a young age. I have lived in Oakland, CA my whole life. Though a city, I was fortunate to have almost unlimited access to the local trails and a family that took me camping often. <br>
        In middle school I joined the local Scout troop with my friends which furthered my love and interest in nature. I participated in mnay servic projects to help better preserve the nature. <br>
        Some fun facts about me: <br>
        <ul>
            <li>If I could have any superpower I would choos invisibility because I could listen in on things and go places I would alwasy have access to</li>
            <li>If i could live anywhere in the world I would live in England because it is still a very major 1st world country that has many job oppurtunities but I like there policies on health care and gun control. I also really like the landscape there.</li>
            <li>I can't pick one food to eat for rest of my life because I am sure I would get bored of anything but if I had to pick a cuisine to eat for the rest of my life then I would pick either Indian or Meditteranian.</li>
        </ul>
